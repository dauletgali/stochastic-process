Dear student this is python script for the Stochastic process class at Nazarbayev University. 
This script can be used to solve homeworks to check your answers. 

Two types of Markov chain :1.continuous , 2 Discrete

In Discrete case initialize with your transition matrix and use findUsualStaff() method to find:
  1. Classification of each state: Recurrent or Transcient
  2. Stationary Distribution
  3. Mean Recurrence time

In Continuous case initialize with Generator or Jump matrix. One of them is enough for finding second one.
Use forward equation in order to write the forward equation on paper. (but you will need to solve it by yourself) 





Discrete case more useful!
